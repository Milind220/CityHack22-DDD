## Description of the Project (300 words)

ClearMynd is a Platform as a Service which helps individuals seek Mental Health support. This is done by targeting a few significant pain points. The first one being that Mental Health help in Hong Kong is inaccessible. Furthermore, there is a lack of good and easy to access information for people to access the relevant medical professionals. Furthermore, there is a lack of trust and fear when it comes to Mental Health treatment. This platform allows doctors to list themselves and include a personalized profile that communicates who they are, thus giving users more of an understanding of who they are approaching. Furthermore, users can put in their preferences which will then play into our recommender algorithm and give them the best choices possible. This all solves the fundamental problem of making Mental healthcare more accessible for everyone
